As a ex-developer of recruitment industry software, I present to you my vision of a recruitment startup.  This is not an empty vision; it is therefore defined by constraints, rather than boundless platitudes.

# 1. We will not change the way you are hired.

If *who-you-know* is not important, why is linked-in such a success?

If *trends* aren't important, why are you more likely to be hired into machine learning than A.I.?

# 2. We will not send spam.

Our brand would be trashed by sending machine-generated unsolicited email.

When someone wants to change their job, they will seek out information themselves.

Is our aim to produce and sell the best recruitment technology, or to become another recruitment spammer?  The latter is a very crowded place.

# 3. We must seek multiple types of data on the candidate.

If your recruitment startup just-mines-github, you may as well give up.  The best candidates know more than just a programming language; they have industry domain knowledge.

In order to determine the knows from the knows-not, you must examine a variety of data.

The candidate must offer such data, or they will feel like they have been stalked.

# 4. No recruitment products exists in a vacuum.

Recruitment agencies use a variety of data sources in discovering candidates.  

We will seek to become an actor that can co-exist with huge competitors.

We must structure our whole product for interoperability.

We seek network effects.

We must be international.

## That is

1. We will operate a candidate-facing web portal that is sane to use.

2. We will scan all types of data including traditional CVs, source code, personal home pages, social media profiles, and the web-presence of a candidate's current employer.  

3. All data will be provided voluntarily by candidates who are looking for a job.

4. We will provide external machine interfaces (e.g. real-time webservices) to every part of our product. 

5. Our objective is to be more capable than the competition via a thorough understanding of current industry practise and desire.

6. We will build a following through excellence of delivery, not by filling inboxes with spam.

7. We keep our business model focussed on assumptions that hold true everywhere, and not merely in narrow geographical corridors.
