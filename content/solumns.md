## Solumns: An evil puzzle game

![Solumns logo](/image/solumns.png)

Solumns is an extension of the concept of [Bastard Tetris](http://blahg.res0l.net/2009/01/bastet-bastard-tetris/) to the universe of [Columns (the classic Sega Game)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columns_(video_game)).  As such it a parody of Columns where the CPU intentionally fucks you over.
