# Fat Ephemeralization and The Guarded Stewardship of Communication Epicentres

## Classic ephemeralization

Buckminster Fuller's coined the term "Ephemeralization" to describe a trend in technology whereby more can be achieved with proportionally less expenditure of matter and energy, "until eventually you can do everything with nothing.""  His classic example is of the technological progress of distance measurement.

* First we used compression: the ruler.
* Then tension: the rope.
* Then light; with the knowledge that luminance dissipates across a distance with respect to the inverse square law.
* Now radio waves, microwaves, and computers which decode the data.

As this process has  we have gone from measuring the fish we catch, to the length of a coast, and now the distance between galaxies.  Similar examples can be found in other disciplines: in architecture there were columns, then arches and domes, then the move to stronger materials used in skyscrapers.  The realisation of ephemeralization in Architecture led Buckminster to develop low material structures e.g. his famous geodesic dome.

In an environment of comprehensive mass production, the cost of manufacturing a good approaches the cost of its component atoms.  I.e. the cost of finding the correct arrangement of those atoms becomes negligible due to the scale of the manufacturing process.  In this situation, ephemeralization is a profoundly optimistic theory; when we can do everything with nothing, there will be profound wealth and quality of life for all.

## Fat ephemeralization

Ephemeralization applies across the technological spectrum, but its consequences are not always so rosy as in the context of mass-manufacturing.  Consider broadcast technologies:

* First we had the runner.
* Then we had the letter; one runner could carry many letters.
* Then we had the printing press: as many copies of your letter as you like.
* Then the radio station: instant transmission of across vast distances.
* Now we have the datacentre: enabling global many-to-many publication streams.

At each stage we do more with less, but at each stage too, the system has become more centralized as pragmatic concerns limit the ability of an individual to control the medium of publication.  I would guess almost every reader owns a ruler, and many a rope;  certainly we all have access to some form of light.  In each of our homes we have an abundance of methods whereby we can measure distance.  On the communication front, home printer ownership in the industrialized world only became common in the 1990s.

For hundreds of years, access to printing methods were strictly controlled.  Even with a relaxation of social attitudes, individual printing remained a pragmatic impossibility until computers became a commodity.  Ironically, a situation which has made much print media obsolete.

Need I ask how many correspondents own a radio transmitter with enough power to rival a local commercial station?  Or how many own or rent a single computer server: let alone a cluster of 500?

Although different technological fields have experienced the same phenomenon of ephemeralization, a stark difference in the ownership and control of the resulting product has emerged.  Should we conclude that the manufacturers of metre sticks, lasers, ropes, and other measurement devices have an altruistic intent, while purveyors of computer technology intend to enslave the population?  No: there are fundamental forces at work, and in this essay I intend to enumerate them:

* The software business is factory of services: Software Services and Gateway Devices
* The information content of thought: The Complexity Of Thinking Machines
* The technical difficulty of participating: The Brains of the Sneakernet

## Software Services and Gateway Devices

* Software is a service industry, not a manufacturing industry
* Mobile phones do not give the user control; merely access to a service
* Mass uptake is a new phenomenon; mass-production was well under way in Buckminster's days.
* Data centres as service factories

## The Complexity Of Thinking Machines

* Shannon information content in prose versus scalar measures
* In technical terms, is a far more difficult task to copy a letter than to take a measurement, even of a very long distance

## The Brains of the Sneakernet

* Consider the complexity of analogue thinking machines
* Design an algorithm in terms of the sneakernet
* The commercial failure of Windows home server; Mac Server
* The attitudes of Linux users
