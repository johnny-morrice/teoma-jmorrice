## Godelbrot: Unix-style Mandelbrot Renderer

![Mandelbrot set](/image/mandelbrot.png)

Godelbrot is a Unix-style Mandelbrot renderer.  It is designed to be extensible both in terms of its algorithms and in its usage as a command line app.  It currently supports native precision rendering, and a somewhat naive arbitrary precision renderer. Future plans include automatic video rendering and a permutation-based renderer.
